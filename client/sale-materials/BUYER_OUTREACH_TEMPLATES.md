# Buyer Outreach Email Templates

**Use these exact templates. Do not oversell.**

## Template 1: Cold Outreach to MSSPs

**Subject:** Security scanning infrastructure — strategic partnership inquiry

---

Hi [Name],

I built an internal security scanning platform that's outperformed what we needed. We're now evaluating whether to continue scaling it ourselves or transfer ownership to a strategic partner.

**Quick context:**
- Evidence-based scanning (every finding has proof)
- API-first architecture (OpenAPI/Swagger native)
- Built-in compliance mapping (SOC 2, PCI-DSS, GDPR)
- False positive reduction engine

Given [Company]'s focus on managed security services, I thought this might be relevant infrastructure for your team.

Happy to share a short demo if there's interest. No pitch — just showing what exists.

Best,
[Your name]

## Template 2: Cold Outreach to Pentesting Firms

**Subject:** Automated recon infrastructure — potential fit?

---

Hi [Name],

Quick note — I've built a security scanning platform that handles the automated discovery and evidence collection phase of assessments.

It's designed to:
- Generate audit-ready evidence automatically
- Reduce false positive noise by ~50%
- Handle API security testing (BOLA, BFLA, mass assignment)
- Export to SARIF for CI/CD integration

We're exploring whether this makes more sense as internal infrastructure for a firm like [Company] rather than scaling it as a standalone product.

Worth a 15-minute conversation?

Best,
[Your name]

## Template 3: Cold Outreach to Compliance SaaS Companies

**Subject:** Technical evidence collection for compliance — infrastructure available

---

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] focuses on [SOC 2 / GRC / compliance automation]. I built something that might be complementary.

It's a security scanning platform that generates evidence documentation automatically — the technical artifacts compliance teams need for audits.

**What it does:**
- Continuous security posture monitoring
- Compliance mapping to SOC 2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, ISO 27001
- Evidence chain with cryptographic timestamps
- Ready-to-export audit reports

We're evaluating strategic options for this platform. Would [Company] benefit from adding technical evidence collection to your stack?

Happy to show you a quick demo.

Best,
[Your name]

## Template 4: Warm Intro Request (To Send to Connectors)

**Subject:** Intro request — security infrastructure buyer

---

Hi [Name],

Hope you're well. Quick ask.

I built a security scanning platform that's ready for acquisition. Looking for intros to:
- MSSPs adding scanning capabilities
- Pentesting firms seeking automation
- Security tool companies expanding offerings
- Compliance SaaS companies needing technical evidence

Do you know anyone at companies like [Company A], [Company B], or similar who handles M&A or strategic partnerships?

Happy to share a one-pager if it helps.

Thanks,
[Your name]

## Template 5: Follow-Up After No Response (Day 7)

**Subject:** Re: [Original Subject]

---

Hi [Name],

Following up on my note last week. Completely understand if timing isn't right.

If helpful, here's a 30-second summary:
- Enterprise security scanning platform
- Reduces false positives by 50%+
- Includes compliance mapping + evidence chain
- Evaluating strategic partnership or acquisition

If this isn't relevant for [Company], no worries at all. Would appreciate a quick "not interested" so I can focus elsewhere.

Thanks,
[Your name]

## Template 6: After Demo — Moving to LOI Discussion

**Subject:** Next steps after demo

---

Hi [Name],

Thanks for taking time to see ShieldScan. Based on our conversation, it sounds like [specific use case they mentioned] could be a good fit.

**To move forward:**
1. I can open our data room (architecture docs, IP summary, roadmap)
2. We can schedule a technical deep-dive with your team
3. If there's alignment, we can discuss LOI structure

Similar security infrastructure assets typically trade in the €600K-€1M range depending on integration scope. Happy to discuss what structure makes sense for [Company].

What works for you?

Best,
[Your name]

| "I need to sell quickly" | Destroys negotiating leverage |
| "It's not quite finished" | Seeds doubt |
| "We couldn't get traction" | Implies failure |
| "I'll take whatever offer" | Price anchors to zero |

---

## ✅ POWER PHRASES TO USE

| Use This | Why It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| "Evaluating strategic options" | Sounds planned, not desperate |
| "Outperformed expectations" | Implies success |
| "Transfer ownership" | Professional framing |
| "Similar assets trade at..." | Anchors high without demanding |
